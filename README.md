# Palindrome Checker

A palindrome is a word or phrase that can be read the same way forwards and backwards, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

__Note:__ You'll need to remove all __non-alphanumeric__ characters (punctuation, spaces and symbols) and turn everything into the same case (lower or upper case) in order to check for palindromes.


## Tasks

- You should have an *`input`* element with an __id__ of *`text-input`*.

- You should have a *`button`* element with an __id__ of *`check-btn`*.

- You should have a *`div`*, *`span`*, or *`p`* element with an __id__ of *`result`*.

- When you click on the *`#check-btn`* element without entering a value into the *`#text-input`* element, an alert should appear with the text "**Please input a value**".

- When the *`#text-input`* element only contains the letter **A** and the *`#check-btn`* element is clicked, the *`#result`* element should contain the text "**A is a palindrome**".


- When the *`#text-input`* element contains the text **eye** and the *`#check-btn`* element is clicked, the *`#result`* element should contain the text "**eye is a palindrome**".

- When the *`#text-input`* element contains the text **_eye** and the *`#check-btn`* element is clicked, the *`#result`* element should contain the text "**_eye is a palindrome**".

- When the *`#text-input`* element contains the text **race car** and the *`#check-btn`* element is clicked, the *`#result`* element should contain the text "**race car is a palindrome**".

- When the *`#text-input`* element contains the text **not a palindrome** and the *`#check-btn`* element is clicked, the *`#result`* element should contain the text "**not a palindrome is not a palindrome**".

- When the *`#text-input`* element contains the text **A man, a plan, a canal. Panama** and the *`#check-btn`* element is clicked, the *`#result`* element should contain the text "**A man, a plan, a canal. Panama is a palindrome**".

- When the *`#text-input`* element contains the text **never odd or even** and the *`#check-btn`* element is clicked, the *`#result`* element should contain the text "**never odd or even is a palindrome**".

- When the *`#text-input`* element contains the text **nope** and the *`#check-btn`* element is clicked, the *`#result`* element should contain the text "**nope is not a palindrome**".

- When the *`#text-input`* element contains the text **almostomla** and the *`#check-btn`* element is clicked, the *`#result`* element should contain the text "**almostomla is not a palindrome**".

- When the *`#text-input`* element contains the text **My age is 0, 0 si ega ym**. and the *`#check-btn`* element is clicked, the *`#result`* element should contain the text "**My age is 0, 0 si ega ym. is a palindrome**".

- When the *`#text-input`* element contains the text **1 eye for of 1 eye**. and the *`#check-btn`* element is clicked, the *`#result`* element should contain the text "**1 eye for of 1 eye. is not a palindrome**".

- When the *`#text-input`* element contains the text **`0_0 (: /-\ :) 0-0`** and the *`#check-btn`* element is clicked, the *`#result`* element should contain the text "**`0_0 (: /-\ :) 0-0` is a palindrome**".

- When the *`#text-input`* element contains the text **five`|\_/|`four** and the *`#check-btn`* element is clicked, the *`#result`* element should contain the text "**five`|\_/|`four is not a palindrome**".

- When the *`#text-input`* element contains an **alphanumeric palindrome**, the *`#result`* element should **correctly identify it as a palindrome**.

- When the *`#text-input`* element contains **a random sequence of alphanumeric characters that is not a palindrome**, the *`#result`* element should say **it is not a palindrome**.
